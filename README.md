# bug_diary
A place to write down bugs that I spend a good amount of time resolving. 

## Format
Each bug recorded should strike to have the following  
- description (include the actual error messages if possible)
- why it takes a good amount of time resolving it
- solution

## File Naming
`bug_diary_<4-digit-year><2-digit-month>.md`
